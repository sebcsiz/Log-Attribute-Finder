# LogAttributeFinderWithBash

The same thing as LogAttributeFinder, but designed to be used in Powershell. And not created using Java Swing :)

## How to use

### This example is assuming the use of Git Bash

1. Clone this repository into an easy to access folder: `git clone https://github.com/sebcsiz/LogAttributeFinderWithBash.git`
2. Open powershell and change your directory to the folder where this repository was cloned to
3. You will need to compile the `.java` file. This can be done as follows: `javac attSearcherViaBash.java`. This will create a new file in your folder called `attSearcherViaBash.java`. This is the file that will be executed.
4. Finally, to run this program use: `java attSearcherViaBash`
